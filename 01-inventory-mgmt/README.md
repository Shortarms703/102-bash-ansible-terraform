# Inventory Management

## Inventory basics

The default location of the inventory file is under `/etc/ansible/hosts`. It is a standard practice to organize your folder structure by project and include the relevant inventory within the folder, and set that directory within the `ansible.cfg` file for the project. Example:

```text
├── \
├── ansible.cfg
├── files
├── inventory
│   └── hosts.yml
├── roles
└── templates
```

Create the hosts.yml file. 

```bash
mkdir inventory
vi inventory/hosts.yml
```

`inventory/hosts.yml`

```yaml
nginx:
  hosts:
    webserver
ubuntu:
  hosts:
    webserver:
      ansible_host: webserver
    pki-server:
      ansible_host: pki-server
  vars:
    ansible_user: ansibleuser
```

Create the `ansible.cfg` file. 

```bash
vi ansible.cfg
```

`ansible.cfg`

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
host_key_checking = False
```

We can test the inventory by pinging the hosts

```bash
ansible all -m ping
```

## Additional Information

You can also specify a particular inventory directory, or directories, using the -i flag when running your playbook:

`ansible-playbook get_logs.yml -i staging -i production`

You can create your inventory file in one of many formats, depending on the inventory plugins you have. The most common formats are INI and YAML. A basic INI `/etc/ansible/hosts` might look like this:

```ini
mail.domain.com

[webservers]
foo.domain.com
bar.domain.com

[dbservers]
one.domain.com
two.domain.com
three.domain.com
```

Here’s that same basic inventory file in YAML format. YAML will be used for the all of the following examples as well:

```yaml
---
ungrouped:
  hosts:
    mail.domain.com:
webservers:
  hosts:
    foo.domain.com:
    bar.domain.com:
dbservers:
  hosts:
    one.domain.com:
    two.domain.com:
    three.domain.com:
```

## Groups

### Default Groups

Even if you do not define any groups in your inventory file, Ansible creates two default groups: `all` and `ungrouped`. The `all` group contains every host. The `ungrouped` group contains all hosts that don’t have another group aside from `all`. Every host will always belong to at least 2 groups (`all` and `ungrouped` or `all` and some other group).

### Hosts in Multiple Groups

You can put each host in more than one group. For example, a production web server in a data center in Atlanta might be included in groups called `[prod]`, `[atlanta]` and `[webservers]`

Extending the previous YAML inventory to include what, when, and where would look like this:

```yaml
ungrouped:
  hosts:
    mail.domain.com:
webservers:
  hosts:
    foo.domain.com:
    bar.domain.com:
dbservers:
  hosts:
    one.domain.com:
    two.domain.com:
    three.domain.com:
east:
  hosts:
    foo.domain.com:
    one.domain.com:
    two.domain.com:
west:
  hosts:
    bar.domain.com:
    three.domain.com:
prod:
  hosts:
    foo.domain.com:
    one.domain.com:
    two.domain.com:
test:
  hosts:
    bar.domain.com:
    three.domain.com:
```

In the example above, you can see that `one.domain.com` exists in the `dbservers`, `east`, and `prod` groups.

### Grouping Groups: Parent/Child Group Relationships

You can create parent/child relationships among groups. Parent groups are also known as nested groups or groups of groups. For example, if all your production hosts are already in groups such as `atlanta_prod` and `denver_prod`, you can create a `production` group that includes those smaller groups. This approach reduces maintenance because you can add or remove hosts from the parent group by editing the child groups. To create parent/child relationships for groups, use the `children:` entry.

Here is the same inventory as shown above, simplified with parent groups for the `prod` and `test` groups. The two inventory files give you the same results:

```yaml
ungrouped:
  hosts:
    mail.domain.com:
webservers:
  hosts:
    foo.domain.com:
    bar.domain.com:
dbservers:
  hosts:
    one.domain.com:
    two.domain.com:
    three.domain.com:
east:
  hosts:
    foo.domain.com:
    one.domain.com:
    two.domain.com:
west:
  hosts:
    bar.domain.com:
    three.domain.com:
prod:
  children:
    east:
test:
  children:
    west:
```

## Variables in Inventory

You can store variable values that relate to a specific host or group in inventory. To start with, you may add variables directly to the hosts and groups in your main inventory file.

We document adding variables in the main inventory file for simplicity. However, storing variables in separate host and group variable files is a more robust approach to describing your system policy. Setting variables in the main inventory file is only a shorthand.

You can easily assign a variable to a single host and then use it later in playbooks. You can do this directly in your inventory file:

```yaml
atlanta:
  hosts:
    host1:
      http_port: 80
      maxRequestsPerChild: 808
    host2:
      http_port: 303
      maxRequestsPerChild: 909
```

If all hosts in a group share a variable value, you can apply that variable to an entire group at once.

```yaml
atlanta:
  hosts:
    host1:
    host2:
  vars:
    ntp_server: ntp.atlanta.domain.com
    proxy: proxy.atlanta.domain.com
```

You can apply variables to parent groups (nested groups or groups of groups) as well as to child groups using `vars:`. A child group’s variables will have higher precedence (override) than a parent group’s variables.

```yaml
usa:
  children:
    southeast:
      children:
        atlanta:
          hosts:
            host1:
            host2:
        raleigh:
          hosts:
            host2:
            host3:
      vars:
        some_server: foo.southeast.example.com
        halon_system_timeout: 30
        self_destruct_countdown: 60
        escape_pods: 2
    northeast:
    northwest:
    southwest:
```
